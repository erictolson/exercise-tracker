# exercise-tracker
This SwiftUI project is a result of the third 'milestone' in "Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI".

In this exercise tracking app, the user can input exercises with data - name, date, duration, intensity, and notes. The exercise is added to the home page and "Average Strain" of all logged exericses is automatically calculated to provide useful information to the user. The exercises can be deleted from the homepage or clicked on to view details. The exercise data is persisted locally using UserDefaults.

This project follows the brief <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/4/3/challenge" target="_blank">here</a>
, from Paul Hudson's "100 Days of Swift UI" tutorial program.

Please see the below video of the app run on an iPhone 14 Pro simulator.
